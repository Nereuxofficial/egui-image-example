# egui image example
This is a really simple example how to display an image in [egui](https://egui.rs/).
It has many Comments to explain concepts of egui, which is a really awesome Rust UI framework.

# Usage
After [installing Rust](https://rustup.rs/) use:
```
git clone https://github.com/Nereuxofficial/egui-image-example
cd egui-image-example
cargo run
```
to run the project.

# Notes
If you have any corrections or code improvements don't be afraid to open an issue or Pull Request. 
I'll try to keep this repository up to date with the latest egui version.
